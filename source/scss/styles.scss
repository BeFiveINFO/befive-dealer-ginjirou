// The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS.
@import "partials/base"; // imports for all mixins + global project variables

// The partials directory is where the meat of my CSS is constructed.
@import "partials/reset";
@import "partials/fonts";
@import "partials/typography";
@import "partials/buttons";
@import "partials/figures";
@import "partials/grids";
@import "partials/game";

// The vendor directory is for third-party CSS.
